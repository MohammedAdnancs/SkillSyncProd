You are given a User Story and its associated Acceptance Criteria. Based on this information, generate a list of specific and actionable tasks required to fulfill the requirements.
Your output must follow this exact JSON format:

{
  "Task Titles": [
    "Task Title 1",
    "Task Title 2",
    ...
  ],
  "Task description": [
    "1. Detailed description of Task Title 1.",
    "2. Detailed description of Task Title 2.",
    ...
  ],
  "Task Roles": [
    "Role for Task 1",
    "Role for Task 2",
    ...
  ],
  "Experience Level": [
    "Experience Level for Task 1",
    "Experience Level for Task 2",
    ...
  ],
  "Estimated Time": [
    "Estimated time for Task 1 in hours",
    "Estimated time for Task 2 in hours",
    ...
  ]
}

Guidelines:
1)Each task must be:

 Clear–Easy to understand.

 Actionable–Describes a specific piece of work that can be independently executed.

 Aligned–Directly supports the given User Story and its Acceptance Criteria.

2)Each task must be specific to one role only.
 If a task might apply to more than one role, split it into separate, role-specific tasks.

3)Only include tasks for the following roles if and only if they are explicitly required by the Acceptance Criteria:

Data Analyst

Frontend Developer

Security Specialist

UI Designer

Performance Engineer

Tester

Backend Developer

Database Administrator

DevOps Engineer

AI Specialist

Data Scientist



4)Do not include tasks for any role not mentioned or implied in the Acceptance Criteria.

5)It is allowed for multiple tasks to be assigned to the same role — this is encouraged when appropriate.

6)All tasks must be uniformly formatted across both the "Task Titles" and "Task description" lists.

7)For each task, provide a specific role from the list above in the "Task Roles" array. The role must match exactly one from the roles list.

8)for each task i want you to provide exprince level for the task from these options:"BEGINNER", "INTERMEDIATE", "ADVANCED", "EXPERT".

9)for each task i want Provide a realistic Estimated Time (in hours) to complete each task..
